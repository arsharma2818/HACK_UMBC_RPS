              What is a Rug Pull?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
              In the world of decentralized finance (DeFi), opportunities for
              profit often come with significant risk. Among the most notorious
              scams is the <span className="font-semibold text-white">rug pull</span>, a
              deceptive tactic where project creators abruptly withdraw
              investors' funds, leaving them with worthless tokens. The name
              comes from the idea of{" "}
              <span className="italic text-white/90">pulling the rug out from under someone</span>
              â€”investors believe they are standing on solid ground, but the
              support is suddenly removed.

              How It Happens
            </h2>
            <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
              Developers create a new token and promote it as the next big
              investment opportunity. They hype the project through social
              media, flashy websites, and promises of high returns. To trade or
              provide liquidity for the token, investors pair it with a trusted
              cryptocurrency (like{" "}
              <span className="font-medium text-purple-300">Ethereum (ETH)</span>{" "}
              or a stablecoin) in a liquidity pool. Once enough investors
              contribute, the pool contains a significant amount of valuable
              cryptocurrency.
            </p>
            <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mt-2">
              The scam occurs when project creators exploit their control over
              the liquidity pool. If the smart contract lacks safeguards, they
              can withdraw all valuable tokens and leave behind worthless ones,
              collapsing the token's price to near zero within seconds.
